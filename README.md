üîí‚ú® Implementing a Security System in C++: Enhancing User Protection ‚ú®üîí

I am excited to share with you a project I recently worked on‚Äîa security system implemented using C++. This project aims to provide robust protection to users and ensure the safety of their sensitive information. Let's delve into its features, use cases, and functionalities!

‚öô Features:
‚ø° Registration: Users can register by providing their username, password, and age. The system securely stores this information.
‚ø¢ Login: Users can log in using their registered username and password. The system verifies their credentials and grants access upon successful authentication.
‚ø£ Change Password: Users have the option to change their password for added security. The system authenticates the old password before allowing the update.
‚ø§ Data Persistence: User credentials are stored in a file, ensuring that the information remains intact between program executions.

üîê Use Cases:
‚ø° Personal Accounts: This security system is perfect for personal accounts, such as email or social media. Users can register and log in securely, safeguarding their personal data.
‚ø¢ Sensitive Information: Applications dealing with sensitive information, such as financial or healthcare systems, can benefit from this security system. It adds an extra layer of protection for user data.
‚ø£ Multi-User Systems: This system can be extended to support multiple users, each with their own credentials and access privileges. It ensures that only authorized individuals can access specific resources.

üìö Functionalities:
‚ø° Registration: Users can enter their desired username, password, and age to create an account. The system validates and securely stores this information.
‚ø¢ Login: Users provide their username and password for authentication. The system compares the credentials with the stored information and grants access if they match.
‚ø£ Password Change: Users can update their password by providing their old password, followed by the new password. The system ensures a secure password change process.
‚ø§ Secure Storage: User credentials are stored in a file using a secure approach, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data privacy.
‚ø• User-Friendly Interface: The system offers a simple and intuitive command-line interface, guiding users through the registration, login, and password change processes.

I thoroughly enjoyed developing this security system, aiming to empower users with a robust and reliable defense against unauthorized access. It serves as a foundation for protecting personal and sensitive information in various applications.
